### DOCUMENTATION 

At the moment, [this Google doc is the most up-to-date shortform documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NsRewxAu9X8dQMUTdN0eeJeRCr0HmU0pUjpKB4gM-xo/edit?usp=sharing) for pinouts and hardware details


### Demonstrations+HelloWorlds

Starter code in various platforms - Arduino, Pico SDK, CircuitPython, Micropython

By far the most developed is [Chris Johnson's ComputerCard library](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Workshop_Computer/tree/main/Demonstrations%2BHelloWorlds/PicoSDK/ComputerCard) for SDK and Arduino: 

### RELEASES 

[Working and work-in-progress code for many program cards.](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Workshop_Computer/tree/main/releases) 

My suggestion for the first 100 projects is that people grab numbers & folders in the 'releases' folder - by sending pull requests - then share whatever they're comfortable sharing - uf2, source, just documentation, or just a link to your own repo/web/gists, whatever works best. I don't have much experience of this kind of collective development, so would be delighted if better approach emerges.  

Release documentation: I've been making [little](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19z0S9cpGnyhb7lVmBPHYjTZLpEB-Xg-v9zzfXCjCjOQ/copy) [leaflets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10R8onfP5JAq9MpOgVSa4sAhxg-WTx7_0-Q1fY0MUDho/copy) for each card, designed in Google Sheets, but you might experiment with other types of documentation
