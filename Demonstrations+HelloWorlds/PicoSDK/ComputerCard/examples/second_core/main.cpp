/*

Multicore processing example, showing one way of generating CV signals with
code that takes longer than a sample time at 48kHz.

ComputerCard's fixed 48kHz clock means that these routines can't be called
in ProcessSample(), but we can set up a loop on the second core of the RP2040
to run the slower code, and use the ProcessSample function only to update the
jacks when the slower routine has produced a new value.


In this example, an LFO calculated from the exponential of a sum of sine waves
is calculated on the second core taking at about 12kHz, roughly four times slower
than the audio samples. This is fast enough for an LFO, but aliases heavily if 
pushed much into audio rate.


In this example, the ProcessSample function does no interpolation - only a 
zero-order hold of the last value from the second core calculation.

A more sophisticated example would use linear (or better) interpolation of
these (non-equally-spaced) values.



User interface:
---------------
 
Main knob + CV in 1:    Speed
Knob X:                 LFO shape
Both audio and CV outs: LFO output
