# Arduino Pico 

This contains a few examples created with the Arduino IDE and the [Earle Philhower Arduino Pico core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico).

It's also possible to use the [ComputerCard library](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Workshop_Computer/tree/main/Demonstrations%2BHelloWorlds/PicoSDK/ComputerCard) in Arduino IDE, which is recommended.
