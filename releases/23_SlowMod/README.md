SlowMod
=======

Powerful modulation for the Computer module of the Modular Music Thing Workshop
System.

It offers four LFOs controled by the main knob. From minute long phases, up to
low audio rate. Audio1 is the fastes, CV2 the slowest.

Use inputs acts as VCAs for the corresponding outputs.

Knob X controls the intensity of cross modulation between the LFOs. Knob Y
crossfades each output with the inverted neighbor output (e.g. Audio 1 output
fades between Audio 1 and inverted Audio 2). CCW for no crossfade; center to
mirror both 1 and 2 outputs; CW to swap and invert 1 and 2; 8-10 oclock for
wobbly CV output.

Pulse 1 and switch up pauses all LFOs.
Pulse 2 and switch down randomizes the phase of all LFOs.


Installation
