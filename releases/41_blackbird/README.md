# Blackbird v1.1

A fully monome-crow-compatible program card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

This enables you to:
- Live code with the workshop computer connected to a non-workshop computer running [druid](https://monome.org/docs/crow/druid/)
- Connect a [monome norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) via USB and run scripts on norns that interact with crow natively (try [awake](https://llllllll.co/t/awake/21022), [buoys](https://llllllll.co/t/buoys-v1-2-0/37639), [loom](https://llllllll.co/t/loom/21091) ... many of these also allow you do use a monome grid for WS interactions)
- Connect the workshop to a non-WS computer running [Max MSP or MaxforLive](https://monome.org/docs/crow/max-m4l/) with Ableton and use the monome-built M4L instruments to make the WS interact with Ableton or your own Max creations. 
- Write and upload your own (simple) program cards in the [Lua (5.4.8) language](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/). Upload to the WS computer via the "u" command in druid (on a non-WS computer). Uploaded scripts are saved to flash on the **physical card itself**- So you can write many different blackbird cards and hot-swap! If you want the name of your patch saved to flash for future reference (printed to host at startup) make the first line of your script start with three hypens `---`.

  > [NOTE] 
  > Make sure you wait for blackbird to fully start up before attempting to upload a lua script from druid. Startup is complete when welcome messages are printed in druid and the bottom-left LED starts flashing. Sending commands before blackbird is fully online can cause weirdness.

Blackbird does everything monome crow can do and works with all (I hope!) existing crow scripts. It has also been extended with Blackbird-specific functionality via the `bb` namespace. 

A great place to get started is the [original crow documentation](https://monome.org/docs/crow/) since the examples there work here perfectly according to the hardware mapping below. More docs linked below.

Also check out the examples directory in this repo for some sample scripts (more to be added soon!)

Tested with druid, norns, MAX/MSP, pyserial - works with **ANY** serial host that sends compatible strings.

## Hardware Mapping

Blackbird maps the Workshop Computer's hardware to crow's inputs and outputs as shown below. Details in the tables that follow.

## How It Works

Blackbird communicates with host applications (druid, norns, Max/MSP) over USB serial by using exactly the same protocol as real crow, and presents itself over USB in such a way that existing hosts don't know the difference between blackbird and crow.

## Other Blackbird-specific goodness

### Noise Generation

**Audio-rate noise action** with `bb.noise()` - generates noise directly in the audio loop for clean, efficient noise generation on any CV/Audio output. Optional paramater sets the noise level between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (full vol, default).

Example:

```lua
output[4]( bb.noise() )

--OR

output[2].action = bb.noise(0.5) -- define action
output[2]() -- run the action
```

### Define an 'ASAP' function
`bb.asap` - Run code as fast as possible in the control thread with no detection. Useful for updating parameters smoothly with knobs. Use carefully as if you do much in here then performance will be impacted.

Only runs if it exists. To clear/stop this function use `bb.asap = nil`

Example:
```lua
bb.asap = function()
    myParameter = bb.knob.main
end
```

### Check which inputs are plugged in

**Check if inputs are connected** with `bb.connected` - Query whether a cable is plugged into any input jack. This uses the Workshop Computer's built-in normalization probe hardware to detect physical cable presence.

Available for all six input jacks:
- `bb.connected.cv1` / `bb.connected.cv2` - CV inputs
- `bb.connected.pulse1` / `bb.connected.pulse2` - Pulse inputs  
- `bb.connected.audio1` / `bb.connected.audio2` - Audio inputs

Returns `true` if a cable is plugged in, `false` if the jack is empty.

Example:
```lua
-- optionally attenuate an incoming voltage with a knob,
-- but use the knob if nothing is plugged in
bb.asap = function()
  myparameter = bb.knob.main
  if bb.connected.cv1 then
    myparameter = myparameter * input[1].volts
  end
end
```

### Performance characteristics

Blackbird uses a dual-core architecture optimized for responsive, jitter-free output:
- **Core 1 (audio thread)**: Outputs CV slopes sample-by-sample at 9.6kHz for zero-jitter precision
- **Core 0 (control thread)**: Processes Lua scripts, metros, and ASL actions with ~1ms latency
- Timer callbacks (metros, ASL triggers) are processed in 8-sample blocks for optimal balance between responsiveness and CPU efficiency

This architecture provides excellent timing accuracy for musical applications while maintaining stability even under heavy scripting loads.

## Known Issues

A few things that are on the radar but that I don't plan to fix (at least not now). If you think any of them are dealbreakers please file a github issue and we can debate!

- Setting `clock.tempo` above 500 bpm can cause crashes. Slow down!
- Running scripts with references to the `ii` table produces harmless (but chatty) lua nil global errors. Ideally these would be silent until/unless i2c support is somehow added/defined for an alleged eurorack-computer-only-future-module.
- System does not prevent receipt of serial comms during startup that are known to cause issues. This is doc'd in the overview but could be prevented in code entirely in a future version.
- Wobblewobble norns script doesn't play nice with blackbird as is. I think the solution is to turn down the frequency that supercollider is triggering output.volts message dispatch in the norns-side code but this is untested.
