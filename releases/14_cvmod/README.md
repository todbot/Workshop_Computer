# CVMod

CVMod is a card inspired by Make Noise's *MultiMod* module. Its development is recorded in a [~3 hour video stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSL_SinqrY).


CVMod simulates a loop of tape (up to 8 seconds long) onto which one channel of CV is recorded. Four tape 'read heads' move around the tape loop and their values are output onto jacks.

### Controls/Jacks
- **Audio In 1 jack**: CV input
- **Audio/CV Out 1/2**: four CV outputs
- **Knob X** (+ CV in 1): duration of tape loop
- **Main Knob** (+ Audio in 2): speed of read heads. Speed matches record head when main knob is at 12-o'clock (top right LED lit)
- **Knob Y** (+ CV in 2): phase of read heads (offset from recording head)
- **Switch down**: Reset position of read heads
- **Switch up**: toggle through read head motion types: Ramp/Saw/Triangle/Sin/Stepped
