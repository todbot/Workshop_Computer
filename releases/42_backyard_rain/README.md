# Backyard Rain Soundscape

A port of the [Backyard Rain Soundscape](https://briandorsey.itch.io/backyard-rain-soundscape) Playdate app to the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer. 

Nature soundscape audio. A cozy rain ambience mix for background listening. You control the intensity. This card plays rain ambience which was recorded in my backyard. 

Crafted Volts is developed in a different GitHub repo, visit [Crafted Volts](https://github.com/briandorsey/mtmws_cards/tree/main/backyard_rain) for documentation and to download releases of the UF2 image.
