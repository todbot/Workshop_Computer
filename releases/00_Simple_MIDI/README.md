### How to Calibrate 
- Hold down the momentary toggle switch on startup 
- Release the switch 5 seconds after startup 
- The centre left LED will start to flash
- Patch the top oscillator in the Workshop System to an output so you can hear it 
- Make sure FM is fully off  
- Use a tuner to the oscillator to C3
- Patch the left CV output to the top oscillator 'Pitch' input 
- If the oscillator changes tune (it probably will, a little bit) you need to calibrate 0V
- Flip the toggle switch up
- The led will start to flash more slowly 
- Now you can use the big knob and the X knob as coarse/fine controls to set the position of 0v. Fiddle around until C3 is back in tune
- When you're ready, flip the toggle switch down. 
- Now tap the toggle switch, and the LED will move to the top left LED 
- This indicates it is sending +2V from the left hand output 
- Flip the switch up, and tweak the knobs until the oscillator gives a C5 in tune. 
- Push the switch back to the middle to save that setting, then tap down again to set -2V to C1
- Tap the switch again, and the LED will move to the right column, in the middle. 
- This represents the 0V output for the right hand CV output. 
- IMPORTANT: Repatch at this point, so the right CV output controls the Bottom oscillator. 
- (The oscillators aren't calibrated, so each output will be calibrated to a specific oscillator's quirks!) 
- You can tap through the voltages to check everything is working as it should, flipping up to change any voltages you're not happy with. 
- Once you're finished, press reset to return to normal MIDI mode. 

### Using the Eeprom calibration data in other cards 
- This card includes several useful classes 
- However, I (Tom) wrote it, so it's not very well organised, and can certainly be improved. 
- CV.h is Chris Johnson's delta/sigma code, which pushes 19bit precision from 11 bit PWM 
- DACChannel.h uses the calibration data to create  calibration constants. ChatGPT wrote most of this, so I don't really understand it, but it seems to work. 
- calibration.h organises the reading and writing of data to the Eeprom, with error checking. This was a Tom + ChatGPT collaboration, hopefully a good basis for incorporating the calibration code in other cards. 
    - The memory map for calibration makes space for 10x calibration points for both channels, but this only uses 3. 
    - There are certainly ways to automate the calibration process to make it more precise and easier to use. 
- Click.h is a little short tap/long tap library I wrote for Startup

### Includes 
Responsive Analog Read by Damien Clarke
https://github.com/dxinteractive/ResponsiveAnalogRead
Adafruit Tiny USB Library 
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino 
Earle Pilhower's arduino-pico 
https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico  

### Compilation options: 
Board: Generic RP2040 
Flash Size: 16MB (No FS) 
CPU Speed: 133MHz 
Boot Stage 2: W25Q16JV QSPI/4 (for the newer 2mb cards) 
USB Stack: Adafruit TinyUSB 

### Installation 

- To install the UF2: Push the boot select button (remove the main knob on Computer), it's on the right 
- Connect the front USB to the computer 
- Hold down boot and tap reset (the button at the bottom by the card slot 
- A folder should appear on your desktop called RPI RP2 
- Drag simplemidi.uf2 into that folder 
- The system should reboot and the folder disappear 
- Now check your DAW for midi interfaces - you should find one called Music Thing Workshop System MIDI or something similar to that 

### Changes 


#### v0.6.0
- Update Arduino Phillhower Pico core from 3.9.2 to 5.3.0 = updates TinyUSB and includes multiple [bugfixes](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/pull/2492) 
- Increases buffer sizes (if editing and recompiling, before building, edit the file `tusb_config_rp2040.h` file to increase buffer sizes from 64 to 512 (targeting Windows stability)) 
- Change the `SWITCH_DOWN` value from 500 to 340 - 500 was missed on some boards making it impossible to enter calibration 
- Change `CableName` from 1 to 0 (targeting Windows stability)
- Add `TinyUSBDevice.task();` to all loops  to make sure USB system is kept alive 
- Set pitch CV outputs to 0v before any MIDI notes are received, to avoid 'jump' after calibration completion. 
- Change midi output notes from knobs and CV to correct values, [matching documentation](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/Computer_Program_Cards/#00-simple-midi) 
- Reduce extraneous MIDI output by only sending notes when MIDI changes, rather than underlying analog reads. 
- Turned off MIDI thru, so Midi notes are not sent back out from the Workshop System 

#### v0.5.0
- Fixed issue on 0.3.0 where calibration mode could not be entered without a serial connection 

#### v0.3.0
- First upload with calibration etc
