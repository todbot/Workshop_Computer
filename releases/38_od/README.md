# Od

Od is a program for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System's Computer
module that simulates the Lorenz system in order to produce loop-able 
control voltage and pulse signals that display sensitivity to initial conditions.

To use, download the latest .uf2 file from the 
[release page](https://github.com/MJLMills/mtmws_od/releases)
and copy to the Computer module following the 
[Workshop System instructions](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/Computer_Program_Cards/).
The latest documentation is available 
[here](https://github.com/MJLMills/mtmws_od/blob/main/docs/od.pdf).

### Issues and Contact
This project is developed and documented in
[a separate repo](https://github.com/MJLMills/mtmws_od), issues and feature 
requests can be raised there, or by finding the author via the Workshop System 
Discord (@sneddo_trainer). The program uses the 
[pyworkshopsystem](https://github.com/MJLMills/pyworkshopsystem) repo, a
reusable package for building programs for the Computer module with 
MicroPython.
