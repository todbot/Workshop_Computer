# Od

Od is a program for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer
module that simulates the Lorenz system in order to produce loop-able 
control voltage and pulse signals that display sensitivity to initial conditions.

This project is developed and documented in
[a separate repo](https://github.com/MJLMills/mtmws_od), issues and feature 
requests can be raised there, or by finding the author via the Workshop System 
Discord (@sneddo_trainer). The majority of the core module code is in the 
[pyworkshopsystem](https://github.com/MJLMills/pyworkshopsystem) repo, a
reusable package for building programs for the Computer module with 
MicroPython.

A .uf2 file will be provided once features are finalized and tested and all 
packaging is complete. For now it is possible to try the module out using the 
provided main.py file (which contains the complete module code).
